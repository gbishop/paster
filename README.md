# Paster: Create a bookmarklet to paste text into the gmail compose window

I use the Canned Response feature of gmail a ton and hate that I have click the little pull down arrow, wait an indeterminate amount of time for the menu to appear, then hit just the right entry to enter my canned message. Why can't I do it from the keyboard?

I tried a variety of Chrome apps and AutoKey but none of them worked consistently. 

So I wrote this little web app to create a javascript bookmarklet to paste text into the gmail compose window. I copy the bookmarklet text and paste it into the _edit search engines_ dialog in Chrome. When I want to send the access code message for [Tar Heel Reader](http://tarheelreader.org), I type CTRL-L to focus on the address bar, type thr, and hit enter. 

This code is free for any use.
